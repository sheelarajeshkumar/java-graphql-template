== Java + GraphQL Demo Steps

In this demo, I'll show how to build a GraphQL API with Java and Spring Boot. I'll also show how to test your GraphQL API using JUnit 5.

This demo is an abbreviated version of https://developer.okta.com/blog/2020/01/31/java-graphql[How to GraphQL in Java], designed for live coding.

**Prerequisites:**

* https://adoptopenjdk.net/[Java 11]+
* https://httpie.org/doc#installation[HTTPie]
* An https://developer.okta.com/signup/[Okta Developer Account] (we will create this)

TIP: The brackets at the end of some steps indicate the IntelliJ Live Templates to use. You can find the template definitions at https://github.com/mraible/idea-live-templates[mraible/idea-live-templates].

=== Create a GraphQL API with Java and Spring Boot

// todo: update the blog post to use latest Spring Boot
. Create a new project on https://start.spring.io[start.spring.io] with web, Spring Data, Spring Data REST, and H2 or https://start.spring.io/#!type=maven-project&language=java&platformVersion=2.3.2.RELEASE&packaging=jar&jvmVersion=11&groupId=com.oktadeveloper&artifactId=graphqldemo&name=graphqldemo&description=Demo%20project%20for%20Spring%20Boot&packageName=com.oktadeveloper.graphqldemo&dependencies=web,data-jpa,h2,data-rest[use this link].

. Expand the downloaded package and add GraphQL SPQR (GraphQL Schema Publisher & Query Resolver, pronounced like _speaker_) as a dependency.
+
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.leangen.graphql</groupId>
    <artifactId>graphql-spqr-spring-boot-starter</artifactId>
    <version>0.0.4</version>
</dependency>
----

. Create a `Food` entity class. [`graphql-food`]

. Create a `FoodRepository` class to persist your entity. [`boot-repo`]
+
[source,java]
----
import org.springframework.data.jpa.repository.JpaRepository;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Repository;

@Repository
interface FoodRepository extends JpaRepository<Food, Long> {
}
----

. Create a `FoodService` to read, save, and delete your entity. [`graphql-service`]

. Notice that you're able to define calculated properties to entities. In `FoodService`, you declared the method `isGood()` as a property that can be queried for each food.

. Create a bean to initialize the app with sample data. [`graphql-init`]

. Enable the web UI to test the GraphQL API by adding the following to `application.properties`.
+
[source,properties]
----
graphql.spqr.gui.enabled=true
----

=== Run Your Java GraphQL API

. Run your project with `./mvnw spring-boot:run`

. Open your browser to `http://localhost:8080/gui` and run a sample query.
+
[source,gql]
----
{
  foods {
    id
    name
    isGood
  }
}
----

. You can also a specific food by ID using a query like the following:
+
[source,gql]
----
{ food(id: 1) { name } }
----

. Notice that you are able to manipulate the response. On that last query, you asked only for the name of the food and the API didn't return the `id` nor the `isGood` property.

. Create a new food by running the `saveFood()` mutation:
+
[source,gql]
----
mutation {
  saveFood(food: { name: "Pasta" }) {
    id
    isGood
  }
}
----

. Query all the foods again, and you should see the newly added "Pasta" there.

=== Test Your Java GraphQL API with JUnit 5

. Update `GraphqldemoApplicationTests` to call your API via HTTP and wrap the query in a JSON object with a single property called `query`. [`graphql-listFoods`]

. Run `./mvnw test` to make sure everything works.

=== Secure Your Java GraphQL API

. Run the Okta Maven Plugin to create an Okta account and configure your Spring Boot app to work with it.

  ./mvnw com.okta:okta-maven-plugin:register
  ./mvnw com.okta:okta-maven-plugin:spring-boot

. To authenticate and see your access token (required to use the API), create a `MyAccessTokenController` that displays the access token. [`graphql-token`]

. Restart your app and go to `http://localhost:8080/my-access-token`.

. If you want to use the http://localhost:8080/gui[web UI], click on **HTTP HEADERS** at the bottom left and add the following.
+
[source,json]
----
{ "Authorization": "Bearer <your_access_token>" }
----

. Click the **Copy CURL** button in the top right of the web UI to see how to call your GraphQL API with cURL.

. You can also use https://httpie.org/[HTTPie]:

  http POST http://localhost:8080/graphql query='{foods{id,name}}' 'Authorization: Bearer <your_access_token>'

. Congrats! You now have a fully secured GraphQL API. ðŸŽ‰

==== Make Your JUnit Tests Security-Aware

. Run `./mvnw test` to see that tests fail with `403 Forbidden`.

. This happens because your tests are not security-aware. To fix that, you need to add `spring-security-test` as a dependency to your `pom.xml`.
+
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.security</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-security-test</artifactId>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
----

. Then, update `mockMvc.perform()` to add `.with(SecurityMockMvcRequestPostProcessors.jwt())`:
+
[source,java]
----
mockMvc.perform(MockMvcRequestBuilders.post("/graphql")
        .with(SecurityMockMvcRequestPostProcessors.jwt()) // <- ADD THIS LINE
        .content("{\"query\":\"{ foods { id name isGood } }\"}")
        .contentType(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)
        .accept(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON))
        .andExpect(status().isOk())
        .andExpect(content().json(expectedResponse))
        .andReturn();
----

. Convert to static imports and your code will be more concise.
+
[source,java]
----
mockMvc.perform(post("/graphql")
        .with(jwt())
        ...
----
+
The `jwt()` method instructs the test to inject a JWT authentication and act accordingly as if a user is authenticated.

. Add a test to make sure add and remove are working. [`graphql-tests`]

. Run the test in IntelliJ and show how it passes.
